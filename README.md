# idp_linkerizer
 Predicts linker identity for best distance map compared to experimental data of amyloid beta 42 peptides

 Begin with embedding each amino acid within a linker as a vector of their
 (1) Charge
 (2) Hydrophilic-Lypophilic Balance (HLB) index as a measure of hydrophobicity
 (3) Molecular Weight of Amino Acid Residue (Da)
